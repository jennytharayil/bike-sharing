# bike-sharing
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

The assignment is to model the deman for shared bikes with the given data. This model would be used to understand how the independent variables play a role in increasing the user base. Based on this, management can manipulate the business strategy inorder to increase the user base.
